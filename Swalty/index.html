          <p>
            Established in 2022, two friends, Jeane and Denise, started chasing a dream that's origins started back when their
            boys were in grade school - to own an adorable shop, market local talent, and to help others find the perfect gift
            while finding joy in the experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Long before Swalty Sisters was born, these two friends became part of a wonderful sisterhood of Moms, who
            one husband coined the "OMG" - the Original Mom Group - legends in their own minds. This group of many strong
            personalities has a foundation rooted in their love of Jesus, family, food, cocktails, and SHOPPING! Most are 
            sweet, more are salty, but all are family. Jeane and Denise want to extend that invitation of sisterhood to YOU 
            and yours!
          </p>
          <p>
            Swalty Sisters specializes in local, classy, and sassy gifts to fit every personality from sweet to salty.
            The hope is that guests will find something they want, along with just the right thing for thier love, the kids,
            grandma, the parentals, that crazy uncle, and all their friends, even the snarky and outrageous ones. Items
            can be personalized, and custom gift baskets curated to fit the taste and personality of the giftee. Our
            goal is to create a charming, fun, and unforgettable experience where our guests feel like family.
